#Zip Debugger

This directory contains the Zip System Debugger.  If you wish to use it,
you'll need to define something that implements the DEVBUS interface,
as found in devbus.h.  Basically, the debugger expects to interact with the
Zip System across a 32-bit bus.  Since this interaction is hardware system
specific, the implementation for your system isn't provided here.

If you are wondering what the Zip System Debugger looks like, you'll find
that it works in a fashion very similar to the bench test program zippy_tb
found in the bench/cpp directory.  The big difference is and will be that
zippy_tb allows clock for clock testing, whereas the debugger allows
instruction to instruction testing.  There isn't  supposed to be any difference
between the two, but there may be.  This is why I run the zippy_tb program:
to find errors in the CPU, whereas a normal debugger is supposed to find
errors in the user program.
  
Now that I have break point functionality in the CPU, I hope to add
breakpoints to the debugger.

Contact me if you need help building such a capability for your system.
My current implementation transforms a UART signal into 32-bit wishbone
bus interactions which then support this CPU.
