// Project:	Zip CPU -- a small, lightweight, RISC CPU soft core
//
// Purpose:	The purpose of this file is to document an interface which
//		any device with a bus, whether it be implemented over a UART,
//	an ethernet, or a PCI express bus, must implement.  This describes
//	only an interface, and not how that interface is to be accomplished.
//
//	The neat part of this interface is that, if programs are designed to
//	work with it, than the implementation details may be changed later
//	and any program that once worked with the interface should be able
//	to continue to do so.  (i.e., switch from a UART controlled bus to a
//	PCI express controlled bus, with minimal change to the software of
//	interest.)
