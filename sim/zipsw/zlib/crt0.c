// Project:	Zip CPU -- a small, lightweight, RISC CPU soft core
//
// Purpose:	To start a program from flash, loading its various components
//		into on-chip block RAM, or off-chip DDR3 SDRAM, as indicated
//	by the symbols/pointers within the program itself.  As you will notice
//	by the names of the symbols, it is assumed that a kernel will be placed
//	into block RAM.
//
//	This particular implementation depends upon the following symbols
//	being defined:
//
//	int main(int argc, char **argv)
//		The location where your program will start from, once fully
//		loaded.  argc will always be set to zero, and ARGV to a pointer
//		to zero.
//
//	_top_of_stack:
//		A pointer to a location in memory which we can use for a stack.
//		The bootloader doesn't use much of this memory, although it does
//		use it.  It then resets the stack to this location and calls
//		your program.
//
//	_top_of_heap:
//		While not used by this program, this is assumed to be defined
//		by the linker as the lowest memory address in a space that can
//		be used by a malloc/free restore capability.
//
//	_rom:
//		The address of the beginning of a physical ROM device--often
//		a SPI flash device.  This is not the necessariliy the first
//		usable address on that device, as that is often reserved for
//		the first two FPGA configurations.
//
//		If no ROM device is present, set _rom=0 and the bootloader
//		will quietly and silently return.
//
//	_kram:
//		The first address of a fast RAM device (if present).  I'm
//		calling this device "Kernel-RAM", because (if present) it is
//		a great place to put kernel code.
//
//		if _kram == 0, no memory will be mapped to kernel RAM.
//
//	_ram:
//		The main RAM device of the system.  This is often the address
//		of the beginning of physical SDRAM, if SDRAM is present.
//
//	_kram_start:
//		The address of that location within _rom where the sections
//		needing to be moved begin at.
//
//	_kram_end:
//		The last address within the _kram device that needs to be
//		filled in.
//
//	_ram_image_start:
//		This address is more confusing.  This is equal to one past the
//		last used block RAM address, or the last used flash address if
//		no block RAM is used.  It is used for determining whether or not
//		block RAM was used at all.
//
//	_ram_image_end:
//		This is one past the last address in SDRAM that needs to be
//		set with valid data.
//
//		This pointer is made even more confusing by the fact that,
//		if there is nothing allocated in SDRAM, this pointer will
//		still point to block RAM.  To make matters worse, the MAP
//		file won't match the pointer in memory.  (I spent three days
//		trying to chase this down, and came up empty.  Basically,
//		the BFD structures may set this to point to block RAM, whereas
//		the MAP--which uses different data and different methods of
//		computation--may leave this pointing to SDRAM.  Go figure.)
//
//	_bss_image_end:
//		This is the last address of memory that must be cleared upon
//		startup, for which the program is assuming that it is zero.
//		While it may not be necessary to clear the BSS memory, since
//		BSS memory is always zero on power up, this bootloader does so
//		anyway--since we might be starting from a reset instead of power
//		up.

// USE_DMA
// {{{
// A bootloader is about nothing more than copying memory from a couple
// particular locations (Flash/ROM) to other locations in memory (BLKRAM
// and SDRAM).  Our DMA is a hardware accelerator that does nothing but
// copy memory from one location to another.  Why not use the DMA for this
// purpose then?
//
// Here, we have a USE_DMA #define.  When this is defined, the memory copy
// will be done using the DMA hardware accelerator.  This is a good thing,
// and this should be defined.  There are two problems with defining this
// however: 1) It obscures for any readers of this code what is actually
// happening, and 2) it makes the code dependent upon yet another piece of the
// hardware design working.  For these reasons, we allow you to turn it off.

// _start: (Assembly routine)
// {{{
// Notes:
// {{{
// Every computer needs to start processing from somewhere on reboot, and every
// program needs some entry point.  For the ZipCPU, that starting place is the
// routine with the _start symbol.  It is important that this start symbol be
// placed at the boot address for the CPU.  This is the very first address of
// program memory, and (currently) on the Arty board it is placed in Flash at
// _start = 0x4e0000.  To make certain this routine goes into the very first
// address in flash, we place it into it's own special section, the .start
// section, and then tell the linker that the .start section is the first
// section where it needs to start placing code.
//
// If you read through this short assembly routine below, you'll find that it
// does only a small number of tasks.  It sets the stack pointer to point to
// the top of the stack (a symbol defined in the linker file), calls the 
// bootloader, resets the stack pointer, clears any data cache, and then calls
// the kernel entry function.  It also sets up a return address for the kernel
// entry function so that, should the kernel ever exit, it wouldn't exit on 
// any error but rather it would exit by halting the CPU.
