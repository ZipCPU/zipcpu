## Filename:	Makefile
## {{{
## Project:	Zip CPU -- a small, lightweight, RISC CPU soft core
##
## Purpose:	This is a grand makefile for the entire project.  It will
##		build the assembler, and a Verilog testbench, and then
##		even test the CPU via that test bench.
##
##	Targets include:
##
##		bench	Build the CPP test bench/debugger facility.
##
##		doc	Build the ZipCPU chip specification and the GPL
##			license.  These should be distributed pre-built, but
##			you are welcome to rebuild them if you would like.
##
##		rtl	Run Verilator on the RTL
##
##		sw	Build the obsolete assembler, binutils, and GCC.  By
##			default, this also 'install's the compiler into the
##			sw/install/ subdirectory as well.
##
##		test	Run the test bench on the assembler test file.
